If the password is weak then only a small portion of the horizontal bar is highlighted. The greater the strength of the password the more the horizontal bar is highlighted.</p>\n<p>The password strength is also appropriately indicated by coloring the bar in a color associative with good or bad: Green indicating a strong password and red indicating a weak password.</p>\n<h4>How strong a password?</h4>\n<p>The definition of a strong password can be intensely argued. A forced complex password at first glance only spells increased security, but forcing too complex and rigid rules on password can have the opposite effect. As passwords are forced to be complex, they also become increasingly harder to remember by the user. This occasionally leads to a self-destruction of the increased security, as some users simply write it down on a small sticky note and paste it up on their screen in order to remember their new complex password. This is especially a problem in places with the policy of forced password renewal every 3 months.</p>\n<h4>What is a strong password?</h4>\n<p>With the above mentioned in mind, I should stress that a sufficiently strong password does not necessarily need to fulfill all of the rules below, but merely a few will do. Consider the following rules, for each rules followed add a point to the passwords strength level (so that 0 points is the weakest, and 5 is the strongest). UI-patterns.com defines a strong password when it…:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Has more than 8 characters</li>\n<li>Contains both lowercase and uppercase letters</li>\n<li>Contains at least one numerical character</li>\n<li>Contains special characters</li>\n<li>Has more than 12 characters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would result in 6 levels of password strength depending on how many of the above mentioned criteria are being met.</p>\n<h4>Dictionary attacks</h4>\n<p>While the above mentioned password check can easily be done using only client-side javascript, it does not prevent against dictionary attacks. To ease the memorization of passwords, people tend to use real words as passwords and merely substitute characters with numbers or special characters. An example of such a password could be “P@ssw0rd”, which really isn’t a strong password. Modern password breaking software is fairly good at guessing such number/letter substitutions. To check against such strength, you would need to do ajax calls that would check with your own dictionary if the password was strong or not.</p>\n<h4>Choosing an appropriate level of password strength</h4>\n<p>You need to determine the password strength and complexity according to what you want to protect. You need to draw the line somewhere. For 99% of the content out there it can easily be argued that merely the first 2 or 3 rules mentioned above will be sufficient.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use when you want your users to choose passwords for their user accounts that are hard to break or guess by either human or computerized help.</li>\n<li>Use when you want to increase the complexity of your users’ passwords and raise the barrier for attackers tampering with your system.</li>\n<li>Use when you want to be sure that your users know what a good password is and that their chosen password follows such guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design Assets</h3>\n<h4>Image</h4>\n<h5>Description</h5>\n<p>A series of password strength meters showing the different strength indications.</p>\n<h5>URL</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://ui-patterns.com/uploads/image/file/808/best_old_40.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">pwordStrength.jpg</a></p>\n<h5>Attachment</h5>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10332057/69461606-ef2f1980-0d44-11ea-82d8-a743398a3bb0.jpg\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10332057/69461606-ef2f1980-0d44-11ea-82d8-a743398a3bb0.jpg\" alt=\"pwordStrength\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<h4>UI Patterns</h4>\n<p><code>external</code></p>\n<h5>Description</h5>\n<p>A website where users can share and view UI design patterns.</p>\n<h5>URL</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/PasswordStrengthMeter\" rel=\"nofollow\">ui-patterns.com</a></p>\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\n<h4>Navigation</h4>\n<p>The user should be able to navigate in and out of the password field by tabbing through the page and be able to tab over the password strength meter.</p>\n<h4>Keystroke Action</h4>\n<p>The user should be able to use the Esc key to remove focus from the password field and use the Enter key to submit their entry.</p>\n<h4>Make This Component Accessible</h4>\n<p>Description.
