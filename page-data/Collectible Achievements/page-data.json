Construct a consistent family of collectibles that is achieved through mastering a healthy mix of difficulties. Unlock new achievements as easier ones are accomplished.</p>\n<h4>Families of collectibles</h4>\n<p>Let your users specialize in certain types of behavior and show it off to fellow community members. If there are too many users for a single top 10 of the entire site, then create multiple top 10 lists that celebrates different specialities.</p>\n<p>If you’re running a photography website and are rewarding users for uploading great photographs, consider creating specialized awards for different types of photographs instead of just having a best-of-the-best award. It takes different sets of skills to respectively create a great portrait shot and a great action shot. So why not just reward each type?</p>\n<p>Similarly you could award users with a series of different awards focusing on giving feedback: “Best comment in this month”, “Highest rated reply in this month”, or “Elite reviewer”.</p>\n<h4>It should be attractive to be rewarded</h4>\n<p>The Yahoo Design Pattern Library talks about “fetishizing” the awards1. Users should strive to receive a trophy, badge, or achievement – both because it is a challenge to be awarded, but also because it just looks great!</p>\n<p>Give people something to drool over; let people know what can be won. Let them know what are available for them, what they have to unlock, and what they have achieved already.</p>\n<p>Attractive awards work better. Develop attractive trophies with beautifully designed icons. Some games use actual ‘game-pieces’ to represent each achievement.</p>\n<p>Users should be proud to show their awards off. They should be proud to put them on display and be able to play around with their “show room”. If there are enough achievements to play with, you can enhance the user’s experience by letting him or her customize his or her “show room”.</p>\n<h4>Combine easy successes with hard challenges</h4>\n<p>Make some achievements very easy to accomplish, so that the user won’t loose momentum. Combine these with harder challenges that require more time and effort to achieve.</p>\n<p>In games, it is often seen that new achievements are “unlocked” as easier ones are accomplished. Being awarded an achievement that is not readily obtained by a newcomer adds to the user’s feeling of status in- and belonging to the community.</p>\n<h4>Types of achievements</h4>\n<p>There are several types of achievements to reward your users with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Temporal award:</strong> This type of achievement celebrates the winners of one-time events. It includes a time-frame or interval: weekly-, monthly-, or yearly awards are good examples. This kind of trophy is valid, even years after it was awarded: once earned it is never lost. An example could be “Best photography 2009” or “Most points in August 2009”. These are useful for praising consistent top-performers and for giving a wider number of users an opportunity to earn a reputation.</li>\n<li><strong>Top 10% trophy:</strong> This trophy can be achieved just as fast as it can be lost. Whether this type of achievement belongs to a user depends on the status quo of the system. It represents the top X percent or number of community members in the moment, why users needs to maintain his or her activity in order to keep the trophy.</li>\n<li><strong>Participation trophy:</strong> This kind of achievement is often used to link real-life activity with a member profile on a website. An example of such a trophy could be “Participated in the 2009 Christmas party” or if used for an online event: “Participated in the World Photo Challenge”.</li>\n<li><strong>Elite acknowledgment:</strong> It gives a sense of arousal to know that you are better than somebody else. Being assigned “elite” status sparks motivation to further engage oneself into a community, as it does for the members still striving to achieve such status. Furthermore, elite members come out as more authoritative when they speak up, why it can be argued that they should reflect the community’s general opinion, so that they can serve as role models for newcomers.</li>\n<li><strong>Privileged member acknowledgment:</strong> Certain members are so deeply involved in the community or maintenance of the site, that they are bound to be rewarded with a privileged member acknowledgment. Examples are “admin”, “staff photographer”, “moderator”, “staff”, or just “VIP”.</li>\n<li><strong>User-to-user awards:</strong> This is not an achievement, but as they are often shown together with earned collectible achievements, they have been added to the list. These are small awards created by users (or pre-fabricated by the community) and represents gifts a user can give to another user.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What are you awarding?</h4>\n<p>What is your website about? And what object are you awarding? Are you awarding the user’s actions or his or her creations? Are you awarding the user or his or her objects?</p>\n<p>At amazon.com and ebay.com, awards are used to indicate the trustworthiness of a user giving a review, selling or buying. At the Danish car-website vmax.dk, it is each car that can be awarded and not in particular the user. The owner of each car then gets to display his or her achievements for cars owned.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use when you want to make your users explore parts of your product or service that might not otherwise appeal to them.</li>\n<li>Use when you want to make your users use all parts of your product or service and in a manner you intended.</li>\n<li>Use when your users need guidance in exploring your offerings.</li>\n<li>Use when you would like to promote certain parts of your product or service.</li>\n<li>Use when you would like to focus the user’s attention to certain parts of your product or service – for instance in the occasion of an event.</li>\n<li>Use when you would like to give your users an opportunity to achieve a sense status and accomplishment within a community.</li>\n<li>Use when you would like to give your users an opportunity to differentiate themselves from the community or integrate more with the community.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design Assets</h3>\n<h4>Image</h4>\n<h5>Description</h5>\n<p>An achievements page from MapMyRun.com</p>\n<h5>Asset 1 URL</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://ui-patterns.com/uploads/image/file/3311/best_Screen_Shot_2015-01-06_at_18.34.00.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">achievements.png</a></p>\n<h5>Asset 1 Attachment</h5>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10332057/69454364-0d404e00-0d34-11ea-874b-ccca4b5c5393.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10332057/69454364-0d404e00-0d34-11ea-874b-ccca4b5c5393.png\" alt=\"achievements\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<h4>UI Patterns</h4>\n<p><code>external</code></p>\n<h5>Description</h5>\n<p>Asset 1 Description.
