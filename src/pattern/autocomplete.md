caption: Autocomplete
problem: >-
  The user needs an aided search option that makes it easier for the user to
  complete keywords for a search query.
solution: |-
  User encounters suggested matches for their search query.

  The information should remain in the 7+2 to 7-2 rule of thumb.
usage: >-
  * Use to assist with ambiguity-issues, when an item can be entered in multiple
  ways

  * Use when the type of information entered can readily be matched with a
  specific piece of information in the system. E.g. A user may not recall how to
  spell “Amorphous” but is able to input the first 3 letters and find the word
  from the autocomplete list.

  * Use when autocomplete suggestions can be pulled from a set of data that is
  manageable in size.

  * Use when input speed is an important goal

  * Use when input accuracy is an important goal

  * Use when the number of items would be too large or inconvenient to display
  in a standard drop down box.

  * Do not use if you want to provide the user an overview of all options
  available.
