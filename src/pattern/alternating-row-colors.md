problem: >-
  The user needs to visually separate similar looking rows in a table apart. in
  order to match the values of each row.
solution: >-
  User can differentiate between rows, because of the use of different shades.


  User is not distracted by excessive contrast, but rather this pattern usually
  blends into the background.
usage: |-
  * Use when you have several columns in a table
  * Use when the content of each column is often of similar nature
  * Use when there are multiple lines for each row
  * Use when the height of each row varies
