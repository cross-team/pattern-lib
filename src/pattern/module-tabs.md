caption: Module Tabs
problem: >-
  User needs to access information from a single content area that has tabulated
  sections.
solution: >-
  * Present the content of one tab inside a box (content area)

  * Place a horizontal bar on top of the content area with links representing
  tabs

  * Refrain from having more than one line of links in the top horizontal tab
  bar

  * Use color coding or other visual support to indicate what tab is currently
  being viewed

  * Present the content of each tab in the same content area

  * Only one content area should be visible at a time

  * Maintain the same structure of the top horizontal tab bar after a new tab
  has been clicked

  * Only the content area of the tabs and the horizontal tab bar should be
  changed when a user clicks a new tab

  * If possible, the page is not refreshed when a tab is clicked.

  * A new page is not loaded when a tab is clicked
usage: >-
  * Use when there is limited visual space and content needs to be separated
  into sections

  * Use when you need to keep user attention by circumventing page refreshing.

  * Use when section names are relatively short

  * Use when the content for each tab has similar structure

  * Use when you need to show what tab is currently being viewed

  * Do not use when the content inside each pane would function just as well in
  its own separate page.
