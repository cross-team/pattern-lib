  already added to another account.
solution: >-
  User can link an account from another application or platform and import
  contacts and information.
usage: >-
  Make sure the users know that this feature is available before manually
  inputting information.


  Provide ability to search contacts to be imported, and best practice is a
  step-by-step wizard.


  Allow the user to also add import contacts from a settings or configuration
  menu.

  List of imported contacts and data may require search functionality, and
  sorting. It is necessary to be aware that how this information is displayed
  must follow Accessibility standards.
