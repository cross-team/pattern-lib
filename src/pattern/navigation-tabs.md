caption: Navigation Tabs
problem: >-
  User needs to navigate content for a website that is grouped into categories.
  The user also needs a clear indication of where they are on the site.
solution: >-
  * A horizontal bar contains the different sections or categories of your
  website.

  * Each section or category is represented by a tab that most commonly
  resembles a button. This is why the whole button should be clickable, and not
  just the text that labels the section.

  * Optionally, a bar below the top bar can contain subsections of the currently
  selected item in the top bar

  * The navigation tab is persistent across all pages that the tabs link to.

  * The same structure (order) of the navigation tabs should be maintained from
  page to page, so that the user can relate the navigation of the different
  pages to each other.

  * The selected tab should be highlighted to indicate current location.

  * If subsections are used (a second horizontal bar below the top bar) there
  should be a clear visual connection between the currently selected top tab and
  the bar below showing subsections.
usage: >-
  * Use when section names are relatively short

  * Use when you want the navigation to fill the entire width of a page

  * Use when you want to provide a list of the highest available
  sections/subsections of the website

  * Do not use when wanting to show content-specific data. For instance for
  showing latest articles

  * Do not use when there is no need to single-out the currently selected option

  * Do not use when the list of sections or categories call for a “more…” link.
  Then consider another navigation pattern.
