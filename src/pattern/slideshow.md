caption: Slide Show
problem: A collection of media (images or video) displayed in a presentation sequence.
solution: >-
  * User can view several images, one at a time, and navigate backwards or
  forwards or wait for a specific time interval to have the image auto-replaced.

  * User should have controls for navigating the slideshow.

  * User should be able to see where they are in the slideshow, via numbers,
  bullets, thumbnails or pagination.

  * Transitions should feel natural.
usage: >-
  * Use when you need to capture attention using multiple stories and minimize
  screen real estate.

  * Use when you need to direct usersâ€™ attention toward stories that you have
  highlighted

  * Use when you want to allow users to skim through several stories without
  scrolling, doing any other mouse movements, or using any other input devices.

  * Do not use if you want users to view all stories at the same time.

  * Beware of over-usage and combination with other animations, which can lead
  to making a website seem too busy and attention-demanding.
