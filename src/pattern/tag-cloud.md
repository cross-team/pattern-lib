  A tag cloud is a list of tags, where the font size of each tag is larger or
  bigger depending on its weight. Weight in tag clouds can be represented in
  three different ways:




  * Size represents the number of times that a tag has been applied to a single
  item. This kind of tag cloud can help define the distribution of how the item
  is categorized.

  * Size represents the number of items to which a tag has been applied. As a
  presentation of each tagâ€™s popularity. 

  * Size represents the quantity of content items in that category. Tags are
  used as a categorization method for content items1
