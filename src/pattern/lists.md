problem: User needs to view content in a scrollable way.
solution: |-
  User can view content in list form.

  User can navigate the list to link to other pages or select options.
usage: >-
  Arrange the content in a logical order, placing relevant material close to
  each other.


  Provide the user with shortcuts, specially for long lists, this can be done
  via pagination or controls.


  Best practice is to provide user with feedback as they browse the content.


  If items are clickable they must appear interactive to the user.
