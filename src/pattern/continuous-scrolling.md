problem: The user needs to navigate a stream of content to consume it.
solution: >-
  The user scrolls through content, that is being streamed to the "feed", the
  content is rendered ahead of the scroll to provide a sense of continuity.
usage: >-
  * Use when there are more data to show than what would fit on a normal page

  * Use when navigating to a second page of data takes away too much attention
  from the content
