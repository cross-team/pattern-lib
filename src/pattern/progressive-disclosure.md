problem: >-
  The user is overwhelmed by more information than the user requires at that
  moment.
solution: >-
  User can "dig deeper" as information is hidden and shown based on a rule set.


  Popular solutions range from "View more" links, arrows, disabled options, or a
  button to view the next information set to scrolling, Server-side techniques,
  modal windows, pop-up windows, ajax etc.
usage: 'This pattern works best, when information can be shown on a need basis.'
