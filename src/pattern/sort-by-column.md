caption: Sort By Column
problem: >-
  The user needs to be able to sort the data in a table in a logical order based
  on the content in the column.
solution: >-
  The user can sort the columns by clicking the column table header, as a link
  or button.


  The transition should be immediate to the sorted data.


  Feedback for the user can come in the way of an arrow that points either up or
  down depending on the order.
usage: >-
  * Use when the table uses pagination and data spans multiple pages.

  * Use when you want to be able to compare rows in a table â€“ for instance
  numbers.

  * Do not use if the amount of rows are few and the table is easy to search or
  scan.
